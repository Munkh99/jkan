title: 2022-OpenCalls-Hanoi-Step Detector
organization: Unitn
notes: This dataset is from a sensor that returns a label identifying the activity performed by the user, accurately detected using low power signals from multiple sensors in the device. This is achieved using Googleâ€™s Activity Recognition API. Possible activities are; still, in_vehicle, on_bycicle, on_foot, running, tilting, walking. The dataset was collected as part of the WeNet project, a Horizon 2020 funded project that aims at developing a diversity-aware, machine-mediated paradigm for social interactions. It collected information on the eating/drinking activities of the students of the FPT University.
